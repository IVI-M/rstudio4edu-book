Distill looks pretty sleek on its own using the default settings. But fancy knows no limits! Let's put on our finest pearls, and take our demo Distill site for some more customization with the CSS.

For any of these changes, we first have to create a CSS file and then link it to our site via the `_site.yml` page. 

1. **Make a CSS file** by going to *File* > *New File* > *Text File*. 
2. **Save this file** in your root directory as `styles.css`. You can choose a different name if you'd like, but the extension must be `.css`.
3. **Open `_site.yml` and add `css: styles.css`** like we do below. You'll need to make sure that `distill::distill_article` is now on its own line and ends with a `:`, too. 

```
name: "basic-course-distill"
title: "Demo Website"

      href: index.html
    - text: "Lectures"
      href: about.html
output: 
  distill::distill_article
    css: styles.css
```

Now we can start styling!

## Google Fonts

First, 
We can choose new body and header fonts from Google Fonts.

The first thing we need to do is add the following line to the top of our CSS file. This will import all of the Google Fonts that are listed within `|`. We chose these specifically from the Google Fonts website. 

```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Playfair+Display|Asap:400,400i,700,700i|Roboto:400,400i,700,700i&display=swap');
```

### Header fonts

Let's change all the header fonts to a serif font, like "Playfair Display".

```
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: "Playfair Display";
}
```

I like this font, but the letters are a bit too squished for my taste. Let's fix this by adding some`letter-spacing`:

```
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: "Playfair Display";
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}
```

### Body font

body {
  font-family: "Asap";
  color: #1f1f1f;
}

While we're here, let's also change the body's text color to be more of an off-black. 

:::design
Choosing colors that are not at the complete extreme of the color spectrum (e.g. avoiding pure black), leaves you some room to be able to go darker when you want to emphasize something later. If you start out by making your body's text black--then you've already maxed out this option.

# (PART\*) For all educators {-#for-all}

# What's on offer {#teach-offer}

I think that quite early on in this book, we should try to answer the question "I'm an educator...what should/can I make here?".  
I'm not sure whether this should happen here or in the preface, but one way we can do this is with the flowchart. Below is just a *very rough* conceptual sketch of how a flowchart here might be a fun way to give users a visual map of where they could end up after using the rstudio4edu resource. [This is the idea I'm riffing off of.](https://www.beckysimpson.co/flowcharts) 

Needless to say, right now the example below is yucky, too small, and incomplete. And it's also just kind of acting as funny eye-candy. But if we make it nicer (and perhaps summarize it more efficiently with a table beneath it), would this be the spot for it? (Could alternatively place this in the introductory section for the Cookbooks Section--and only include tools that we have cookbooks for (ie. leave out stuff like Connect)).

# Teaching with RStudio {#teach-rstudio}

## IDE stuff

You can use only R, but using RStudio can save you a lot of headache and a lot of time! Best analogy ever: https://moderndive.com/2-getting-started.html#r-rstudio

## RStudio.cloud

## Connect, Server Pro, etc.

# Teaching with GitHub {#teach-github}

Make sure to mention Mine's ghclass package

Happy Git with R for yourself and your students

GitHub Classroom is also a good option to consider

# Teaching learners {#teach-learners}

+ teaching to make reprexes

+ teaching about community/SO/etc

# What to do on day 1 {#teach-day1}

See: https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/issues/47

- Link to mine's eat cake first stuff.
- start with a data package (if you can); caveat: you are teaching importing data.
- link to mine's dsinabox, perhaps garrett's latest repro research stuff
- orient to IDE (great tip by kierisi: play with RStudio IDE themes?)
- start with Rmd (if you can)- you can teach minimal markdown etc.

# Licensing your content

Some opinionated guidance.

Does it make sense to move the Licensing section closer to the end of the book-- after they've created new content (or remixed ours or others') with the cookbooks?

# Remixing licensed content

Recommended ways to offer attribution

If you are reusing others' content in say a workshop with slides, add your attributions on the last slide, and include an "Attributions" section in the repository's READ ME file.

So if it’s a workshop, once on the last slide + in the repo readme. 

If it’s a semester long course, just somewhere on the course website

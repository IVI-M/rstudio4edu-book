- Link to mine's eat cake first stuff.
- start with a data package (if you can); caveat: you are teaching importing data.
- link to mine's dsinabox, perhaps garrett's latest repro research stuff
- orient to IDE (great tip by kierisi: play with RStudio IDE themes?)
- start with Rmd (if you can)- you can teach minimal markdown etc.

## Distill vs R Markdown site {-}

Since the R Markdown .Rmd file is essentially the fundamental unit of most of these sites, it makes sense to compare the other rstudio4edu tools to it. Here we cover Distill. Distill is basically a slightly souped up R Markdown document with some built-in features that would otherwise need to be included more manually into a regular Rmd.

**Similarities**

* Distill and R Markdown can both exist as single pages
* Collections can be combined into a set to create a website
* `rmarkdown::render_site()` or *Build Website* within RStudio will build your site
* Same core website features and configurations for YAML apply
* Messy-ish directories (compared to blogdown where you can bundle things) ?
* `styles.css` can be added to both in the YAML, indented under the output type.


**Unique to Distill**

* `create_website(dir = "<your-directory-name>", title = "<your-site-name>")`
    ** Is `library(distill)` necessary prior to running?
* Allows blog posts to be put into a posts sub-directory?
* Built-in options for a logo [Can this not be done in regular R Markdown?] within the YAML
* Add a footer to all pages with the inclusion of a `_footer.html` to your main project folder
* Built-in option to include Google Analytics 
* Built-in options for creating a little appendix (with optional Licensing and "Corrections" links)
    ** [https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#site_metadata](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#site_metadata)
* Built-in way to specify a custom favicon (the little icon for your site that shows up in your browser tab)
* Built-in option for sharing twitter
* `output: distill::distill_article`

**Unique to R Markdown**

* `rmarkdown:::site_skeleton(getwd())`
* What happens to Rmd's placed in subdirectories?
    ** They're still knit...but not compiled in an automatic and *smart* way (?)
* [Is logo only added with html/CSS?]
* Footer must be constructed using HTML/CSS manually with `includes....` in YAML
* Google analytics need to be inserted manually within HTML file and `includes.. before body` in YAML
* Appendix not an option unless manually built into footer.
* Can you not do this in r Markdown within the YAML?
* `output: html_document`....or whatever else you want.

# Make a site {#make-distill}

## Mental framework: what are we going to make here? {-}

Same idea as an R Markdown site. We need a site yaml + one index.Rmd doc + optional, additional .Rmds (of the Distill variety).

## Getting set up {-}

### Install `distill` 

The distill package needs to be installed from GitHub. You only need to do this once on your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

remotes::install_github("rstudio/distill")

```

### Two getting started workflows {-}

```{r child="modules/github-first-project.Rmd"}

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_website(dir = getwd(), title = "<your-site-name>")
```

\

Though we recommend a “GitHub first” workflow, it is possible to begin by first making a RStudio Distill project in RStudio and then connecting it to GitHub afterwards:

* Click *File* > *New Project* > *New Directory*
* Scroll down and select *Distill Website*
* Then, optionally:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github() # you have to have a PAT setup
```

Regardless of which workflow you choose, your project directory should end up looking like this:

### Add a favicon

You know the little tiny icon that gets placed in the corner of your browser tabs? That's a favicon!

**How to:**

1. Save the image you'd like to use in your project directory. For best results this image should be square.
  + Don't have an image? [Make a favicon with text or an emoji](https://favicon.io/). Download and move the `.ico` file into your project directory.
2. Open your `_site.yml` file.
3. Add `favicon: <insert-path-to-favicon.ico>` --not in quotes!


:::tip

**Note**: In the example above, we can use a PNG image file, but ICO files (with the `.ico` extension) are actually preferred because ________. You can also use a GIF.

### Site footer

Create and save a file in your root directory called `_footer.html`. Its contents will be used as a footer for each of your distill pages.

For example, contents could be something like this:

```

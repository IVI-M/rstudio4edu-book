# (PART) Cookbook: Distill sites {-}

```

# Introduction {-#intro-distill}

Distill is R Markdown's sibling with technical and scientific interests. It is essentially a slightly souped-up R Markdown document that has some built-in features that would otherwise need to be included rather manually in a regular `.Rmd`. 

The original intended use case for Distill was to create a platform where authoring scientific, collaborative content would be made easier. 

**Why Distill?**

* You're creating content that will use citations, appendicies, and footnotes
* You want a site that can acknowledge multiple authors and affiliations
* You want built-in options for things like a logo
* You're fine sticking to the default Distill theme (or you don't mind getting your hands messy with CSS to change your site's aesthetic) and you don't need `code_folding`, `code_download`, or numbered sections. 

You may also want to learn how to use Distill so that you can then create Distill templates that your learners can then use to generate reports, etc. 

## Distill vs R Markdown site {-}

Since the R Markdown `.Rmd` file is essentially the fundamental unit of most of these sites, it makes sense to compare the other rstudio4edu tools to it.

[Venn Diagram?]

![](images/cookbook-distill/venn.jpg){width=70%}

**Similarities**

* Distill and R Markdown can both exist as single pages
* Collections can be combined into a set to create a website
* `rmarkdown::render_site()` or *Build Website* within RStudio will build your site
* Same core website features and configurations for YAML apply
* Messy-ish directories (compared to blogdown where you can bundle things)
* `styles.css` can be added to both in the YAML, indented under the output type.


**Unique to Distill**

* `create_website(dir = "<your-directory-name>", title = "<your-site-name>")`
    ** Is `library(distill)` necessary prior to running?
* Allows blog posts to be put into a posts sub-directory, in contrast to an R Markdown site
* Built-in options for a logo within the YAML
* Add a footer to all pages with the inclusion of a `_footer.html` to your main project folder (and the footer goes all the way across)
* Built-in option to include Google Analytics 
* Built-in options for creating a little appendix (with optional Licensing and "Corrections" links)
    ** [https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#site_metadata](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#site_metadata)
* Built-in way to specify a custom favicon (the little icon for your site that shows up in your browser tab)
* Built-in option for sharing twitter
* `output: distill::distill_article`

**Unique to R Markdown** [ Probably remove]

* `rmarkdown:::site_skeleton(getwd())`
* What happens to Rmd's placed in subdirectories?
    ** They're still knit...but not compiled in an automatic and *smart* way (?)
* A logo can only be added with HTML/CSS-- unless you create your own pandoc template (Ahh!)
* Footer must be constructed using HTML/CSS manually with `includes....` in YAML. And it doesn't go all the way across the page easily. 
* Google analytics need to be inserted manually within HTML file and `includes.. before body` in YAML
* Appendix not an option unless manually built into footer.
* Favicon: can you not do this in r Markdown within the YAML?
* `output: html_document`....or whatever else you want.

* How to compile multiple R Markdown pages into a Distill site
* How to add basic customization to a Distill page that are not easily added to an R Markdown site


## Mental framework: what are we going to make here? {-}

Same idea as an [R Markdown site](#make-rmd). We need a `_site.yml`, an `index.Rmd` + optional, additional .Rmds (of the Distill variety). 

\

# Make a site {#make-distill}

Here we'll show you how to set up a basic Distill site.

Along the way, we point out the features that make Distill particularly useful for scientific and technical content. You can jump to the different parts of this cookbook by using the links below.

\

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', include = TRUE}
build_toc("cookbook-distill.Rmd")
```

\

## tl;dr

**Here's how you make a Distill site:**

[1.](#distill-getting-started) In a GitHub-connected RStudio project, run `create_website(dir = getwd(), title = "<your-site-name>")` to create the files you need.
\


[2.](#distill-edit) Within `_site.yml`, change the output directory to the `docs/` folder so you can be set up for GitHub pages.
\ 

[3.](#distill-edit) Edit `index.Rmd` content to be with whatever you want to put on your homepage. Edit the `about.Rmd`, which will be your second page.
\

[4.](#disill-edit) Run `rmarkdown::render_site()` each time you make changes to any doc to create `.html` versions of your `.Rmd` pages.
\

[5.](#distill-push) Commit and push all changes to GitHub.
\

[6.](#rmd-living) Go to your GitHub repo > *Settings* > *scroll down to GitHub pages* > *select "master branch/ docs folder" from the dropdown menu*. Share your new site URL!
\

[7.](#distill-dress) Customize your site with built-in YAML options.
\

[8.](#new-distill) Add new pages by creating new `.Rmd`s, deleting their individual YAML info, except for the `Title:` and the dashed lines.
\

[9.](#distill-one-yaml) Link new page to the site by referencing it in the navbar section of `_site.yml`.
\

[10.](#new-distill) Always end by knitting or rendering and then pushing to GitHub. 
\



## Getting set up

### Packages

You only need to do this once per computer.

The `distill` package needs to be installed from GitHub. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

remotes::install_github("rstudio/distill")

```


If you'll want to add a `README` to your Distill site, then you should also install the `xfun` package so that the step for rendering your site becomes more convenient. 


As another tip, if you're used to using `install.packages()` for CRAN packages, try using [`pak`](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) instead for installs. It's more efficient.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")

pak::pkg_install("xfun")
```


### Two getting started workflows {#distill-getting-started}

```{r child="modules/github-first-project.Rmd"}

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
distill::create_website(dir = getwd(), title = "Demo Website")
```
\

Though we recommend a “GitHub first” workflow, it is possible to begin by first making an RStudio Distill project in RStudio and then connecting it to GitHub afterwards:

* Click *File* > *New Project* > *New Directory*
* Scroll down and select *Distill Website*
* Then, optionally:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github() # you have to have a PAT setup
```

Regardless of which workflow you choose, your project directory should end up looking something like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo= FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "40%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cookbook-distill/getting-started-directory.png")

```

## Edit and preview {#distill-edit}

Your project directory now has four new important items. We'll touch on the them below:

1. **Delete `_site/` folder.** This is the default output folder, where knitted files live once they've been processed to become `.html` files. We're planning on using GitHub pages to host our site for this tutorial, which means we need to replace this folder with a `docs/` folder instead. We make sure this happens in the next step. 

2. **Open the `_site.yml` file in your root directory, and change the output directory from `"_site"` to `"docs"`**. In general, the `_site.yml` file lets us set options that will affect all pages in our site, and it has the same function here as it does in a typical R Markdown site. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
name: "basic-course-distill"
title: "Demo Website"
description: |
  Demo Website
output_dir: "docs"
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
output: distill::distill_article
```

A few things you'll notice about this YAML, if you're comparing it to an R Markdown site's: 

* The output here has to be `distill::distill_article`. It's okay for this to be on the same line as `output:` or indented on the line beneath it. 

* Weirdly, the `description:` field here is non-functional (as far as I can tell). But we'll use this to create a subtitle of sorts in the indvidiaul YAMLS of our other Distill pages.


3. **Open `index.Rmd`**. This will be our site's homepage. This file *must* be named `index.Rmd`, and it *must* at minimum have `title:`, `description:`, and `site:` lines. Optionally, make a small change to its YAML like changing the text in the `description:`. Something like:

```
---
title: "Demo Website"
description: |
  Welcome to my Distill course page. Here you can find all course logistics and content.
site: distill::distill_website
---

```
4. **Open `about.Rmd`**. Optionally edit it by adding a new line of text. This will be an additional page on our site, and you can change the name of this file to be whatever you want. Additional pages, like this one, at a minimum need to have a non-empty `title:`, but they don't require a `description:` or `site:` line. 

5. **Render your site** with the line below to knit all of your pages in one fell swoop. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render_site()` 
```

You must *always* render your site's pages as the last step before you push to GitHub. Once all of your site's `.Rmd`s have been rendered at least once, then it's okay to knit only the individual pages that you've made changes to (you might want to do this if you have some pages that knit slowly and want to avoid re-rendering everything each time you push). But if you forget to knit or `render_site()`, then you will be wondering why your site hasn't updated on GitHub pages.

:::tip
If the rendered site does not open up automatically in a new window, you can go to the `docs/` folder in your project, click on the `.html` file you want to view, and then `View it in Web Browser`.
:::


## Push to GitHub

1. **Click *Git* ** in the same RStudio pane that also contains the *Environment* tab.

2. **Check the box(es)** under the "Staged" column and click *Commit*.

3. **Add a commit message** and then click *Push*.

<center>![](images/rmd_custom/git1.png){width=400px}<center>


Now we'll get to the good stuff! Let's put this on the internet!

## Make a living, breathing site
```{r, child= "modules/github-pages.Rmd"}

```

You can now edit and knit your `.Rmd` pages to your heart's content. 

## Distill features

After adding some page content, we now demo some core features of Distill sites that you can't get with a regular R Markdown site as easily.


### Authors and affiliations

Within the YAML of an individual Distill page (a.k.a article), you can add multiple author fields with an (optional) affiliation field for each author. Below is an example of what this looks like when it's added to the index page.

While you're here you can optionally add in a `date:` field (which must always be in the order of month, day, then year). Use `"r Sys.Date()`"` to show the current date each time you knit the page. 

All of this info will be placed in a "Title" section at the top of the page. 

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Demo Website"
description: |
  Welcome to my Distill course page. Here you can find all course logistics and content.
author:
  - name: Desirée De Leon
    url: https://desiree.rbind.io
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://rstudio.com
  - name: Alison Hill
    url: https://alison.rbind.io
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://rstudio.com
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
site: distill::distill_website
---
```

</div>
<div class = side2> 


![](images/cookbook-distill/index-authors.png)
</div> 
</div>

### Citations

Including internal citations is made easier with Distill. They appear as numbers, and when hovering over them, you see the full citation info.

To include citations of your own, you'll need to have two things: (1) a file with a list of your references and (2) a link to this file in the YAML of your `.Rmd` page

* **Create the file of listed citations**. This has to be a BibTeX file with citation entries like the ones below, for example. If you use a citation manager (like Endnote or Mendeley), then the easiest way to get a BibTex file is to export a BibTeX file from there (there are many online tutorials that show you how, e.g.  [Endnote](https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/EndNote.html), [Mendeley](https://blog.mendeley.com/tag/bibtex/)). However, you can also make a BibTeX file manually if want to, by creating a regular new text file (*File* > *New File* > *Text File*) and saving it with a `.bib` file extension (we named our `refs.bib`, but you can choose a different name). 


* **Save your BibTeX file** in your project directory.

```
@book{r4ds,
 author = {Wickham, Hadley and Grolemund, Garrett},
 title = {R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data},
 year = {2017},
 isbn = {1491910399, 9781491910399},
 edition = {1st},
 publisher = {O'Reilly Media, Inc.},
 url = {https://r4ds.had.co.nz/},
}

@misc{loremipsum,
  title = {Lorem Ipsum},
  author = {Wasai},
  year = {2015-2019},
  url = {https://loremipsum.io/},
}
```

* **Add a `bibliography:` field to the YAML of your individual `.Rmd`** whose content will contain the citations, then specify the name of your BibTex file. Now you can create inline citations of any reference that exists in this file. 


* **Cite your sources** in the body of the text. The citation should be in brackets and start with an `@` followed by the source's unique ID from the BibTex file (e.g.`[@loremipsem]`). The unique ID is whatever is on the first line of its BibTeX entry, immediately following the `{`. When you cite a source, an appendix will be created at the end of the page (if it doesn't already exist) with a list of all your cited references.

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>
```{r, eval = FALSE}

title: "Demo Website"
description: |
  Welcome to my Distill course page. Here you can find all course logistics and content.
author:
  - name: Desirée De Leon
    url: https://desiree.rbind.io
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://rstudio.com
  - name: Alison Hill
    url: https://alison.rbind.io
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://rstudio.com
bibliography: refs.bib
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"

```
</div>

<div class = side2>

![](images/cookbook-distill/citations-hover.png){width=100%}
<br>

![](images/cookbook-distill/citations-appendix.png){width=100%}

</div>
</div>

The citation feature within Distill was originally intended for citing academic sources, so the display of the citation data in the hovered box and in the appendix looks best when fields like "publisher" and "year" are filled out, but having blank entries for these won't prevent you from creating a citation.

You can read more of the nitty-gritty details about citations, as well as about making your Distill page itself easily citable to others [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html).


### Site footer

A footer is added to your all your pages when you make a file named `_footer.html` that has the content you want. It's automatically applied to all pages when you drop this file into your main project directory. 

1. **Create a new text file** by going to *File* > *New File* > *Text file*.
2. **Save this as `_footer.html`** in your main project directory. Its contents will be used as a footer for each of your Distill pages.
3. **Enter some footer content** and save.

For example, contents could be something like this:

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class =side1>

```
Your Name, youremail@example.com

Your Collaborator's Name, anotheremail@example.com

This content was created using 
the Distill for R Markdown template in RStudio.

```
</div>
<div class= side2>

![](images/cookbook-distill/footer.png)

</div>
</div>

You'll be stuck with the default teal color for the footer unless you change the CSS file, which we demo in the "Make it fancy" chapter. But the nice thing about the Distill footer is that it will carry all across the page, which is not an easy feat to accomplish in some regular R Markdown sites (even if you're not afraid to mess with CSS). 

### Appendix

If there's other content you'd like to add to the Appendix, you can add it by creating a new level 1 or 2 header followed by `{.appendix}` in the body of your Distill page. This will move that content of that section to the appendix, with footnotes and the reference list placed afterwards. 

```
# Acknowledgments {.appendix}

We'd like to thank the following funding sources for making this work possible: 
Source 1, Source 2, and Source 3. 

```
![](images/cookbook-distill/appendix.png)

### Hoverable footnotes

Want footnotes to be read more easily? No problem. Just include `^[footnote here]` whereever you'd like the footnote to go, and it will be automatically numbered, added to the appendix, and expanded when you hover over the number. 

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>
```
# Credits

This course is assigned 
3 credit hours^[A footnote goes here!].    

```
</div>

<div class = side2>
![](images/cookbook-distill/footnotes.png)
</div>
</div>

### Asides

You can also include small notes, images, or plots in the margins of the page by enclosing content within `<aside>` tags, like this (note that the second tag needs a `/`):

**A note**
<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>
```
<aside>
Here is a small side note.
</aside>

```
</div>

<div class = side2>
![](images/cookbook-distill/aside-note.png)
</div>
</div>

**An image**

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>
```
<aside>
![R4DS](http://alturl.com/bmfvq)
</aside>

```
</div>

<div class = side2>
![](images/cookbook-distill/aside-image.png)
</div>
</div>

**A plot**

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>
```
<aside>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
 
p <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year==1977) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()

p
```
</aside>

```
</div>

<div class = side2>
![](images/cookbook-distill/aside-plot.png)
</div>
</div>

### Figure width

Distill allows you do change the width of figures that you produce within code chunks. This includes all sorts of plots but also plain, static `jpg`s and `png`s. The coolest application of the variable widths is being able to produce a figure, plot, or image that extends across the full width of the page. This would work well with figures that have a lot of visual interest -- likes maps or photographs.

To try this out, you can apply `layout = "l-screen"` to the specific code chunk that contains your image or plot. Don't have an image? [Try these](https://unsplash.com/), and then download and move the file into your project directory (or to an `images/` folder in your project directory folder to keep your files more organized).

````clike
```{r layout = "l-screen"}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("images/curves.png")
```
````
Produces this output:

![](images/cookbook-distill/width-full.png)

:::tip
You can use the `l-screen` option creatively to make your image a page banner or a section divider. 
:::

It's also an option to expand the code chunk to be just a bit wider than the main body content, without intentionally stretching the image across the page. It's our opinion that kind of gives off my-pants-are-a-little-too-short vibe --and we're not a huge fan of this option aesthetically. We recommend avoiding it unless you truly feel there's no other way to effectively display your output.

Nonetheless, here are all the [width options available](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/figures.html#wider-layouts):

* `l-body`: (Default) As wide as the body of text.
* `l-body-outset`: Overflows the text-width a bit (Not recommended).
* `l-page`: About 3/4 of the screen width.
* `l-screen-inset`: Stretches across the entire page, except for 15px padding around the sides. 
* `l-screen`: Fully-committed, full screen. Works best for wide, short figures.

You can check out the specifics of Distill figure widths [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/figures.html#wider-layouts). 

### Figure captions and cross-references

You can also include captions for your figures by including `fig.cap =` in the code chunk options. 

````clike
```{r gdpplot, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Reference for Assignment 1"}`r ''`
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
 
p <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year==1977) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()

p
```
````

If you give the code chunk a name, you can use that name later to reference the plot in the body of the text, like so: Figure `\@ref(fig:gdpplot)`. You would replace `gdpplot` with the name of your code chunk. 

![](images/cookbook-distill/figures-caption.png)

:::tip
If the image or figures you're using come from an external source, in addition to using a figure caption, you should also add an `out.extra="class=external"` to the chunk option. This will add a bit of formatting that makes it clear that outside images you're using may not necessarily fall under the same license as the rest of your content, should someone else want to use your materials.
:::


## Dress it up! {#distill-dress}

Many of the customizations you can add to a regular `.Rmd` site, you can also use in a Distill site in the same way--by specifying them in the `_site.yml` file (unless otherwise noted) beneath it `output:` line. We don't cover these options again here, but you can see which ones apply in the list below and learn more about them by clicking on the links.

In addition to these, there are some more options that Distill allows us to specify within `site.yml`, and we cover those in the sections that follow.

**Layout features common to Rmd sites and Distill**

<div class= "col2">

* [Table of contents (TOC)](#rmd-TOC)
* [Link to more pages](#rmd-link-to-more)
* [Dropdown menus](#rmd-dropdown)
* [Align right/ left](#rmd-align)
* [Icons](#rmd-icons)
* [White space*](#rmd-white)
\

</div>
\

\* While you can of course always add more white space between sections in Distill, we think its default spacing is actually pretty good already.

:::tip
**You can't always get what you want**: Note that Distill does *not* give you the option to use a floating TOC, change themes, use `code_download` nor `code_folding` as you can in a regular `.Rmd` site. Another weird thing worth pointing out is that the only way to get a TOC on the `index.Rmd` page is to specify one globally within the `_site.yml`. It cannot be added individually to the index page alone (but it can be to other Distill pages).

### Reuse and licencing

You can include the appropriate copyright license by adding a `creative_commons:` line in your YAML, and it will automatically add a statement to the appendix of your site that lets others know how they can use your materials. In the example below, we add this to the `_site.yml` file.

Common licensing options are described [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/metadata.html#creative-commons).

### Preview images

A preview image is what you see when you share a link for your website on social media or other places. You can choose the image that's used for this a few different ways that are described in detail [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/metadata.html#preview-images). 

### Logo

We can also add a logo to our site, which will appear on the left side of the navbar. 

1. **Save the logo** you want to use in your project directory. You don't have to, but we recommend keeping a subfolder called `images/` where you can place all image files for your site.  
2. **Open your `_site.yml`** file.
3. **Add the lines below** underneath the navbar options in the `_site.yml` file. Enter the file path to the logo on the  `image:` line. If you want your logo to link to a website, enter the link address on the `href:` line.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
logo:
    image: images/logo.png
    href: https://www.rstudio.com
```

Here's what it looks like in the `_site.yml` file:

<div class="side-by-side">

You know the little tiny icon on the left side of most of your your browser tabs? That's a favicon, and here's how you include one: 

1. **Save the image** you want to use in your project directory (or in an `images/` folder). For best results this image should be square. Don't have an image? [Make a favicon with text or an emoji](https://favicon.io/), and then download and move the `.ico` file into your project directory.
2. **Open your `_site.yml`** file.
3. **Add `favicon: <insert-path-to-favicon.ico>`**

<div class="side-by-side">
<div class="side1">
```
name: "basic-course-distill"
title: "Demo Website"
description: |
  A site for a course
output_dir: "docs"
creative_commons: CC BY
favicon: images/favicon.ico
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/logo.png
    href: https://www.rstudio.com
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Lectures"
      href: about.html
output: distill::distill_article
```
</div>
<div class="side2">

![](images/cookbook-distill/favicon-tab.png){width=60%}
</div>
</div>

:::tip
**Note**: In the example above, we can use a ICO image file (with the `.ico` extension), but other file types can usually be used. ICO files are actually preferred for favicons because they do a better job of rendering efficiently across most browsers.

### Google analytics

You can also add an option to your YAML for including a [google analytics tracking ID](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#google-analytics) to your site.

## Caring for your site

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_custom/Caring.jpg")
```

### Adding more pages

You can [add more pages to your Distill site](#new-rmd) in the same way that you would for an R Markdown site. The key is to link the new pages to the navbar in the `_site.yml` file.

### Hiding pages

[Hiding pages](#hide-rmd) can also be accomplished the same way for a Distill site as it would be done for an R Markdown site. If you don't want a file to render, then begin the file name with a `_`.

### Switching from an existing R Markdown site to a Distill site

## Alternatives and drawbacks

One drawback to Distill is that it's not very straightforward to include a README file in your GitHub repository. It can be done if you move the entire site's contents into the `docs/` folder and change the output directory to `output_dir: "."`.

**But I really want a README.md:**

Assuming that you currently have your output directory set to `docs/` for GitHub pages and you don't yet have a README:

1.  Move all of your site-specific content to the `docs/` folder. This includes your `Rmd`s, image folders, etc.-- but not the `.gitignore` or `.Rproj` files.)
2.  Change the output directory in `site.yml` to `output_dir: "."`
3.  Now render all of your pages. The fool proof way to do this is to run the line below in the console (make sure you've installed the `xfun` package (`pak::pkg_install("xfun")`).
```
xfun::in_dir('docs/', rmarkdown::render_site())
```
4. Now you can create a `README.md` in your original project directory. 
5. Commit and push to GitHub


## Existing Distill sites

**For Visualizations**
You can see some examples of the two tools below in action [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/interactivity.html)

* [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/)
* [html widgets]()

```{r, layout="l-screen-inset"}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```

**For Tables**

There are different ways to include tables in your site. None are unique to Distill, but they're useful to know about. You can see examples [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/tables.html).

## What is rstudio4edu?
rstudio4edu is a handbook filled with practical advice and resources (and templates!) for educators who teach with R and RStudio.


## Why use it?
Navigating all "-downs" can be intimidating if you don't have a technical background or a lot of time. rstudio4edu guides you through advanced tooling to help develop and deliver lessons to learners, via making packages, websites, and templates.

Unlike other references, rstudio4edu was designed with educators in mind. It aims to make documentation fun to read and accessible so that you have fun:

* creating new content,
* adopting new tools,
* designing engaging learner experiences, and
* embracing openness in education.

## tl;dr
rstudio4edu will show you to make awesome stuff, and hopefully you'll find yourself smiling while doing it!

["intro.html", "Section 1 Introduction", " Section 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

Inclusion of ‘pro-tips content’ throughout content I do like the pedagogical patterns section, though I see how including something like this greatly increases the scope of our project. I think what I like most about it, is that they’re concrete examples of creative use-cases. The tips and tricks section I find to be useful, practical advice. In thinking of how this applies toour own project, I think a lot of this could be condensed into little “tips” boxes. Different ways of running Jupyter w/ pros and cons. Useful for educators to know ahead of time Stuff I don’t like as much Needs way more color, pictures, graphics. I think there is too much text for this to be an effective way of “selling” the notebooks. You have to read a lot of prefaces before you get to the practical implementations and concrete examples. Tone is kinda dry Not sure if it’s the layout, but I think just by nature of it being a book, it doesn’t feel like as a user that I can or should skip around to only the sections I need. It’s hard to know which sections will be most useful to me when I “arrive” to this resource. "],

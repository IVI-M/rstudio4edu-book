We recommend following the tips on [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) and starting in GitHub before switching to RStudio:

1. Create a GitHub repo for your work.
2. Click the green **Clone or Download** button, and copy the URL.
3. Open RStudio. Click *File* > *New Project* > *Version Control*> *Git*. Paste the copied URL.
4. Click Create Project.
5. Use: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown:::site_skeleton(getwd())
```

(note that we use `:::` here, with three colons!) to generate important infrasctructure files we need.

# (PART) Creating educational content {-}

# Introduction {-}

Note: not teaching others *how to use* R Markdown, but teaching yourself tips/tricks for how to teach others *with* R Markdown.

This will be for static edu materials (as opposed to interactive- i.e., learnR)

# Do you need R Markdown?

Maybe not, can do .R scripts, knitr::spin to GitHub

# Using single R Markdown files 

why, how, common workflows, getting fancy with nice HTML options

## Formatting code

+ [verbatim code chunks](https://yihui.name/en/2017/11/knitr-verbatim-code-chunk/)
+ `knitr` code chunk options (like eval vs echo vs [include](https://yihui.name/en/2017/11/knitr-include-false/))
+ `knitr` [ref.label](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/reference/) to reuse code chunks
+ the `fig.path` thing: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots

## Styling output

HTML output options like floating toc, numbering, code folding, code download (requires theme)

   
## Sharing



+ https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/reference/github_document.html

+ GitHub + ghpages
      
   
## Troubleshooting

[Mine's troubleshooting tips:](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/teach-data-sci-icots2018/01-03-rmarkdown/01-03-rmarkdown.html#30)



+ Make sure RStudio and the rmarkdown package (and its dependencies) are up-to-date.

+ Set a global option for error = TRUE (or for a given chunk) so that your document renders even when there are errors.

+ Donâ€™t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. (If you do still decide to use setwd in a code chunk, beware that the new working directory will only apply to that specific code chunk, and any following code chunks will revert back to use the original working directory.)

#R Markdown Course Sites
Here are some components that your course site should have. 

1) Course Overview
2) Syllabus info
3) Lecture Content (e.g. slides)
4) Assigned readings
5) Lab Content
6) Assignments
7) Possilby a grading dashboard (more info)

Here are some examples of three different course sites that use these components (not necessarily made in R Markdown, but just to give you an idea of what you should be putting in yours.)

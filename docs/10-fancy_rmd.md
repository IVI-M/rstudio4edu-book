# Fancy R Markdown Sites
## Going further with customization

Once you've built the basic structure for your R Markdown site, if you'd like to customize it even further, here are a handful of things you can add!


We'll go over 



The steps below involve a little bit of HTML and CSS work, but you don't have to have much experience in these methods to be able to build something cool.

## CSS crash course
Every element of a website that you see, from links to pictures to paragraphs, has a category label. These labels can be tags (for example, all links on websites have `a` tags, all big headers have `h1` tags), or they can be IDs or classes (described later).  If you know the label for something on a website, then you can style its appearance by using a `.css` file. In a CSS file, you write style rules that will apply to all elements of the same category. This is a very useful thing to be able to do because it allows you to break free from the limitations of built-in templates and themes that come with R Markdown.

Below is a quick example of CSS that would change all link colors to white and all link text from being uppercase:


```r
a {
  color: white;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

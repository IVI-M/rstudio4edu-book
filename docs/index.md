# Preface {-}

Welcome! This handbook was inspired by the [Handbook for Teaching and Learning with Jupyter](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)- a book written by and for educators who teach data science. It is a thoughtful and inspiring resource for all educators, with a focus on the Python ecosystem. We aimed to create a similar resource for educators working with the R and RStudio ecosystem. 

If you do educational work and use tools in this ecosystem, you may have seen a great tutorial made with R Markdown, or attended a streamlined workshop where learning the content was front-and-center and all the headaches around installation and setup were absent. Or maybe you have stumbled upon a polished workshop, book, or course website and thought: __"I want to make that too!"__ So that is what we have set out to do: make a handbook that will fill in those gaps for educators to create educational materials that engage learners, inspire other educators, and most importantly save you time and make it more fun for you to teach.

Paraphrasing from Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester's ["What They Forgot to Teach You About R"](https://whattheyforgot.org/index.html):

> *"We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in creating educational materials, __outside of doing the teaching itself__."*

If you find these materials useful, give us a shout-out on Twitter using `#rstudio4edu`. We hope you do! If you have ideas for ways to improve them, please consider contributing to the project.


## Why `rstudio4edu`? {-}

Educators from a range of fields use R and RStudio in the "classroom." But the definition of the "classroom" is changing. 

The classroom can be an actual one that includes real-time interaction with learners, as in school and university settings. 

Or the classroom can be a virtual one, where learners interact asynchronously with educational materials. For example, learners on their own time can peruse an online tutorial, or they can attend a remote webinar-style workshop where real-time interactions simply aren't part of the education experience.

Finally, there are temporary classrooms- those that pop up like food truck pods. Learners pick a truck to decide what they want to learn, they get served up some educational materials and enjoy it in real-time with an instructor and other learners. The hope is that they pack up some knowledge "to go boxes" that they will put into practice when the instructor is long gone.

We know that people in fields like ecology, sociology, digital history, psychology, biology, genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology, and bioinformatics for education- not just those who teach data science or statistics.


## Who are you? {-}

TO DO: shorten to be more like [Greg's](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:intro-audience)

Who did we make this handbook for? We envision that this handbook is for all end-user teachers: teaching may or may not be part of your formal job description, you may not have formal training in how to teach, and you may teach in a formal classroom setting, but you may also teach virtually (via webinars or online tutorials), or perhaps you teach in short but intense bursts like in-person workshops and small-group trainings. 

In short, if you are a person who needs or wants to create educational materials using R / RStudio, then we hope you'll find this handbook useful- it is definitely for you.

1. **Lucy:** Lucy is a professor of neuropsychology who is responsible for teaching her department’s introduction to statistics to 1100 first-year students every year. (Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have.) When she finds time for it, her research focuses on color perception in infants. Initially she “fell into” using R by way of her research. She is comfortable using R in her research, but she experiences imposter syndrome, especially when in conversation with colleagues who have had formal training in computer science. She has used R Markdown documents before individually, but has never done more then amass them locally. Lucy already uses R in her own analyses, but in the classroom she’s not sure how to use R to replace in-class activities, assignments, etc. She needs materials to produce content that can be adapted for multiple lessons, repeated use, and allows for interaction. She needs something with enough features that will meet her needs as a “power” educator. Has to be no-fuss for students to be up and running with the materials each class-- with so many students, she wants to minimize the instruction time that would be lost to making sure students have the right dependencies, etc. She also needs additional capabilities that her students don’t (grading, tracking student progress, etc). Lucy is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t have a lot of time to learn or test out many new systems for delivering her teaching content. 

1. **Willis:** Willis Workshopper is a senior data scientist at his company, which is an online finance enterprise. He is responsible for training his (remote) team, which involves introducing different models and scripts during online session. During team retreats, he will lead workshops in-person, and occasionally goes to local R meetups, where he also leads short workshops in a more casual atmosphere. Willis considers himself an experienced programmer and has formal training in computer science. He uses R all the time in his work related to analysis. He wants a teaching platform for materials that doesn’t *have* to be template based because each workshop/ training will more or less stand on its own. He’s willing to put in the time to customize his materials to be *exactly* what he wants for each use case. Materials developed need to be interactive/hands-on and also be well-organized and easily implemented by users in both remote (work team) and in-person (meetups) contexts. He also needs a way for his remote team members to share materials with him on occasion and where he can give them detailed feedback. Willis is often (but not always) creating materials that will be disseminated to a completely remote team. Willis needs to know what R tools are out there for him to deliver his content in a way that his learners will find easy to unpack/ use/ etc. He can be very particular about the way something looks and works, so he needs his tools to have the option of being customizable--he’s not afraid of advanced options. 

1. **Ona**: Ona is the head of a team at a university that assists other researchers and organizations with the design of their research studies and evaluation of their progress. Ona leads a small team of employees that come in with different R skill levels (sometimes none). Ona knows R, but would not call herself a programmer. She does not know anything about web development. She has used R Markdown before at a basic level, but has not anything with it beyond that. She knows how to “knit to HTML” but has been emailing the .html files back-and-forth with team members as a means of sharing. She needs to create materials that will get current members on her team up to speed on R and also serve as an internal knowledge repository for incoming new members. Ona has a limited budget to work with, and her team has limited time for training. Currently, Ona’s team does not have enough time to read books dedicated to R, but they benefit from checking online resources (r-bloggers, r twitter, using cheatsheets etc.). She needs to create an online resource for her team that they can consult at any time, but also so more hand-held guided materials for when new members first onboard.
